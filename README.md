### Setup and Install WordPress on Your New site

* To keep your themes, plugins, and more, you'll want to upload your old **wp-content** folder.
* Navigate to your old WordPress site's root folder with your FTP client and find the **wp-content** folder. Download this folder.
* Navigate back to the new WordPress site's WordPress directory. Upload the folder here, overwriting anything that already exists.

* Open the original .sql file with a text editor.
* Open the find and replace function.

## Example lesson

### Introduction
Moving a WordPress website can be a long and complicated process, but it doesn't have to be. You can manage moving a WordPress website yourself with a simple understanding of FTP, your hosting control panel, and some text edits.

Moving your website yourself gives you a lot more control over the migration process and allows you to create local backups as you go. It also allows you to select which features you want to migrate and which you want to leave behind.


### Why Might You Want to Move a WordPress Site?
You may want to migrate your WordPress website due to having a slow hosting provider or issues with your current WordPress environment. Other reasons for migrating your WordPress site may be upgrading your hosting package, or looking to change your URL.

Many hosting providers will handle migration for you. However, if you're running on more of a sandbox style hosting environment, or you're just looking to have complete control over the process, you may want to manage it yourself.

See if students can come up with their own reasons for migrating their WordPress site. Perhaps they have experienced problems in the past and considered moving their website to another location. Ask students when it is a good idea to move a site and when it isn't worth it. Walk through the problems and fears associated with moving a website.

### Introducing the Tools For Migration

There are many ways to migrate a site yourself. There are multiple plugins available that will handle most of the process for you. This includes:

*   WordPress Duplicator
*   WordPress Move
*   BackupBuddy
*   WP Migrate DB Pro
*   myEASYbackup
*   UpdraftPlus
*   WP Clone by WP Academy
*   All-in-One WP Migration
*   ManageWP

This guide will cover migration by using FTP. You will need a basic understanding of how to use an FTP client, along with a text editor capable of find and replace.

Ask students what they have used FTP for in the past and how much experience they have with it. Cover the WordPress root directory structure and how to navigate their WordPress site through FTP.

## Lesson Wrap Up
Follow the exercises above and have the students practice the exercises themselves.
